# Dead Code Cleanup Summary ðŸ§¹

## What Was Removed

### 1. **Duplicate Files**
- âœ… `app/api/patients.py` - Duplicate patient API (kept `patient.py`)
- âœ… `static/js/pricing-config.js` - Unused pricing configuration
- âœ… `fix_database_*.sh/py` - Old database migration scripts

### 2. **Removed from HTML**
- âœ… Removed pricing-config.js script tag from chat.html
- âœ… Removed FAB button for treatment panel

### 3. **Database Tables Already Removed**
According to migrations, these were already dropped:
- Appointments
- Invoices
- Devis (quotes)
- Treatment plans CRUD
- Payment plans
- Scheduled payments
- Schedule blocks
- Patient education
- Financial reports

## What Remains (Still Has Dead Code)

### 1. **CSS File (`static/style.css`)**
Contains styles for non-existent features:
- `#swiss-law .welcome-icon`
- `#invisalign .welcome-icon`
- `.patient-education-btn` and related styles
- `.schedule-treatment-btn`
- Many other styles for removed features

### 2. **Documentation**
- `README.md` - Still mentions 5 AI models, appointments, invoices
- `CLAUDE.md` - Still references removed features

### 3. **JavaScript (`chat-app.js`)**
- Still has pricing configuration code (but it's used by Settings)
- References to treatment scheduling that don't exist

## Current Active Features

The app now focuses on:
1. **AI Chat** - Single "dental-brain" model for treatment planning
2. **Patient Management** - Basic CRUD operations
3. **Settings** - User profile, AI configuration, pricing settings

## Recommendations

1. **Keep the pricing settings** - They're still used in the Settings modal
2. **Clean up style.css** - Remove all styles for non-existent features
3. **Update documentation** - Make README and CLAUDE.md reflect actual features
4. **Consider removing** - The extensive pricing/financial configuration if not actively used

The app is now much cleaner and focused on its core value: AI-assisted treatment planning with patient context.
