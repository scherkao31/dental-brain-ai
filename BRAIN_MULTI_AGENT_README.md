# Brain Multi-Agent Analysis System

## Overview

The Brain interface now features a sophisticated multi-agent AI system that analyzes dental data to discover patterns, rules, and clinical insights. This system mimics how a dental researcher would analyze data - progressively building understanding through multiple specialized agents.

## Architecture

### 4 Specialized Agents

1. **Scanner Agent** (GPT-4o)
   - Quickly scans data chunks to identify interesting patterns
   - Looks for: recurring sequences, timing patterns, material preferences, exceptions
   - Processes data in batches for efficiency

2. **Analyzer Agent** (O1-mini)
   - Deep-dives into patterns identified by Scanner
   - Uses chain-of-thought reasoning for thorough analysis
   - Identifies clinical rules, reasoning, conditions, and exceptions
   - Evaluates reliability based on evidence

3. **Synthesizer Agent** (GPT-4o)
   - Transforms deep insights into actionable clinical rules
   - Generates clear, applicable guidelines
   - Adds metadata: confidence scores, priorities, evidence counts
   - Ensures rules are clinically relevant and practical

4. **Validator Agent** (GPT-4o)
   - Tests generated rules against real data
   - Validates coherence and generalizability
   - Adjusts confidence scores based on testing
   - Only passes rules that meet quality criteria

### Progressive Knowledge Building

- **Working Memory**: Current analysis context
- **Long-term Memory**: Discovered rules persisted to disk
- **Agent Memory**: Each agent remembers its findings for future reference
- **Incremental Learning**: New analyses build on previous discoveries

## User Interface

### Welcome Screen
- Overview of the 4 agents and their roles
- "Lancer l'Analyse Intelligente" button to start

### Analysis Progress
- Real-time progress bar with current stage
- Live visualization of agent thoughts as they work
- Rules appear as discovered with confidence badges

### Discovered Rules
- Cards showing each rule with:
  - Title and summary
  - Confidence level (color-coded)
  - Evidence count
  - Category (pattern, timing, material, etc.)
- Click any rule for detailed view with:
  - Full description
  - Clinical reasoning
  - Supporting evidence
  - Known exceptions
  - Confidence visualization

### Filtering & Organization
- Filter by: All, High Confidence, Pattern Type
- Rules grouped by category
- Persistent storage - rules saved between sessions

## Technical Features

### Smart Data Processing
- Chunks data intelligently by type and relevance
- Cross-references between different data types
- Keyword extraction for efficient matching

### Multi-Model Strategy
- Different models for different tasks
- O1-mini for deep analytical thinking
- GPT-4o for pattern recognition and synthesis
- Optimized for both speed and depth

### Real-time Updates
- Frontend polls for progress every second
- New thoughts and rules appear instantly
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if agents fail
- Continues analysis despite individual errors
- Logs all issues for debugging

## Usage
