# Approved Sequences Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (enhanced_rag_service.py)
✅ Already implemented:
- `search_combined_with_sources()` searches for approved sequences
- They are indexed with type='approved_sequence' in the knowledge base
- Included in search results with proper similarity scoring

### 2. Backend (ai_service.py)
✅ Already implemented:
- Approved sequences included in context formatting with special section "SÉQUENCES APPROUVÉES PAR L'UTILISATEUR"
- Added to references list in `_format_references()`
- Properly prioritized in context ordering

### 3. Frontend (messages.js)
✅ Just fixed:
- Added 'approved_sequence' to typeIcons with ✅ icon
- Added 'approved_sequence' to labels as "Séquence approuvée"
- Also added 'general_knowledge' mapping for consistency

## How It Works

1. **Indexing**: Approved sequences from `DATA/APPROVED_SEQUENCES/` are indexed in ChromaDB with type='approved_sequence'

2. **Searching**: When a query is made, approved sequences are searched alongside clinical cases and ideal sequences

3. **Context**: Approved sequences appear first in the AI context with special formatting indicating they've been validated

4. **Display**: In the chat interface, approved sequences show with a ✅ icon and "Séquence approuvée" label

## Testing

To test:
1. Query for "26 CC" should show the approved sequence with ✅ icon
2. The sequence should appear in references tab
3. AI should prioritize this approved sequence in its response
